- Add state machine logic to PS
// - Setup classes for VU and VULists //
// - Extract unique ID for each VU so we can execute script via popup in MAIN to push live //
- Set up events for lang select menu - menu should be disabled when in WORKING state
- CS sets up the VUs > CS tells PS how many per language to prod and stage, and ID of VU
> PS tells executeScript what it wants to go live, and sets settings in local storage
> PS reads local storage on load, tells CS to continue if items left is not 0
